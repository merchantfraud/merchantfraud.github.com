      <p class="warning">
        * We believe that putting an easy to remove sticker on a surface constitutes free speech.  We do not advocate vandalism.

      <p>You can spread the word:  Most merchants are honest, good people.  But any business should earn money by selling people things they want, not by trying to cheat people out of a few dollars by requiring a minimum purchase when doing so is forbidden both by Visa and MasterCard.  By spreading the word and slapping on a few stickers, we can make a difference.

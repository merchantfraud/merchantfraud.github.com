      <h2>About us</h2>
      <h3>What is MerchantFraud.org?</h3>
      <p>
      MerchantFraud.org is a non profit organization dedicated to fighting unscrupulous business practices through the use of <span class="c1">colorful</span> <span class="c2">stickers</span> <span class="c3">to identify</span> <span class="c4">unscrupulous</span> <span class="c5">businesses</span>*.
      </p>
      <p class="warning">
        * We believe that putting an easy to remove sticker on a surface constitutes free speech.  We do not advocate vandalism. 
      </p>
      
      <h3>How can I help?</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Get Stickers:</strong>  email us at <span class="c6">stickers@merchantfraud.org</span> and tell us how many you need and where you plan to stick them.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Send money:</strong>  we use the money to buy and send stickers only.  100% of donations go to stickers, and all of our workers are volunteers.  Just send us an email at <span class="c4">donations@merchantfraud.org</span> for more information.
      </p>
      
      <p>You can spread the word:  Most merchants are honest, good people.  But any business should earn money by selling people things they want, not by trying to cheat people out of a few dollars by requiring a minimum purchase when doing so is forbidden both by Visa and MasterCard.  By spreading the word and slapping on a few stickers, we can make a difference.
